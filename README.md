- 👋 Hi, I’m @SistrrRatGrrl
- 👀 I’m interested in coding (duh), learning HTML, and digital art.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment ;D. THough, eventually I'd like to make my own portfolio for my art.
- 📫 How to reach me? I mainly respond to emails.
